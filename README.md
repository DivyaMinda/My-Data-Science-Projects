**Introduction:** Welcome to my data science portfolio! 
Over the past six years in the Data Science field, I've collaborated closely with marketing and product leaders of companies like CVS Health and Teladoc Health, successfully driving substantial revenue growth and boosting customer engagement through data-driven strategies. My expertise spans statistical analysis, predictive modeling, experiment design, A/B testing, data visualization, data mining, and automating data pipelines.
This repository is a journal of the projects that have fueled my professional growth and expertise in data science. 


**Repository Contents**

**A/B Testing - Power Analysis for Sample Sizing**

Goal - Summarize the core concepts on hypothesis testing and discuss in detail the process of setting up A/B tests.

Approach - Created hypothetical business problem where we need to test if a new version of marketing content can drive significant member enrollments. Defined the hypothesis for this scenario and implemented Python code for Power Analysis to calculate sample size required to execute the A/B test successfully. 

**NLP Basics in Python**

Goal - Summarize the steps involved in text pre-processing for a Natural Language Processing task - text classification 

Approach - Understand the nuances of NLP through a binary classigication problem -predict if a SMS text is spam or not spam. Performed data exploration, text pre-processing (removing punctuations, tokenization, stemming and vectorization ), feature engineering, predictive modelling (binary classification using Random Forest Classifier)
