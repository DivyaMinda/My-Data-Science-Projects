**About Me**

With over six years of immersion in the field of Data Science, I've had the privilege of partnering with industry leaders in healthcare and retail, such as CVS Health and Teladoc Health. In this journey, I have explored the synergy between data and business strategy, developing analytical solutions that remarkably drove revenue growth and elevated customer engagement. 

My expertise spans a spectrum of disciplines, from statistical analysis to machine learning, experiment design to A/B testing, and everything in between. As an advocate for continuous learning and growth, I'm excited to share my journey and insights with the vibrant data science community. 

  

  

**Portfolio Highlights** 

  

[**A/B Testing - Power Analysis for Sample Sizing**](a-b-testing-power-analysis-in-python.ipynb)

  

Goal - Summarize the fundamental principles of hypothesis testing and discuss in detail the process of designing A/B test experiments. 

  

Approach - Created hypothetical business problem where we will test if a new version of marketing content can drive significant member enrollments. Demonstrated the process of experiment design and implemented Python code for Power Analysis to calculate sample size required to execute the A/B test successfully.

[**NLP Using Python NLTK**](NLP%20using%20Python%20NLTK)

  

Goal - Summarize the steps involved in text pre-processing for a Natural Language Processing task - text classification  

  

Approach - Understand the nuances of NLP through a binary classification problem -predict if a SMS text is spam or not spam. Performed data exploration, text pre-processing (removing punctuations, tokenization, stemming and vectorization), feature engineering, predictive modelling (binary classification using Random Forest Classifier)
